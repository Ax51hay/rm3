  abstract = {Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) are becoming increasingly utilized in Health applications due to their ability to engage patients and support clinical workflows. Yet recent reviews show that our understanding of CUI performance and user preferences towards them is still lacking. This work examines factors that explain people’s preference for engaging with a social needs screening CUI in a clinical context with 41 emergency department visitors. We demonstrate that people with low health literacy and high attitude towards emotional interaction (AEI) prefer responding to questions via CUI rather than a form-based survey. Specifically, participants with low health literacy appreciate the improved understandability offered by the CUI, whereas participants with high AEI appreciate the added level of engagement offered through conversational interactions. Our work advances the understanding of the benefits of CUI for different user groups in health contexts and beyond.},

  abstract = {Chatbots are increasingly used to replace human interviewers and survey forms for soliciting information from users. This paper presents two studies that investigate how the formality of a chatbot’s conversational style can affect the likelihood of users engaging with and disclosing sensitive information to a chatbot. In our first study, we show that the domain and sensitivity of the information being requested impact users’ preferred conversational style. Specifically, when users were asked to disclose sensitive health information, they perceived a formal style as more competent and appropriate. In our second study, we investigate the health domain further by analysing the quality of user utterances as users talk to a chatbot about their dental flossing. We found that users who do not floss every day gave higher quality responses when talking to a formal chatbot. These findings can help designers choose a chatbot’s language formality for their given use case.},

  abstract = {Speech-based dialog systems primarily interact with users through their spoken responses. Understanding users’ perception of, and subconscious behaviors toward, the system’s speech are crucial for improving their design. In the current study, a voice chatbot designed for having a conversation with users in the domain of music is used to test the impact of emotional expressiveness in its text-to-speech (TTS) output. We parametrically manipulated the degree of emotional expressiveness via prosody and lexical choice across conditions. We used a two-pronged approach to test these effects on users: a user interaction study (Experiment 1 – between-subjects design) and an independent perception study (Experiment 2 – within-subjects design). Both studies provide converging evidence that increasing emotional prosody yields more positive perceptions of chatbot interactions, in increasing perception of emotional expressiveness (Experiments 1 and 2) as well as overall engagement, human-likeness, and likability of the bot (Experiment 2). We discuss these findings in terms of theories of human-computer interaction, as well as their implications for conversational design.},

We investigate the use of humor as a repair strategy in an experiment where the voice assistant makes a mistake and then utilizes one of four humorous personalities to repair the breakdown in the conversation. We conducted a study with 30 participants, each of whom took the Humor Style Questionnaire (HSQ) to understand their predisposition to humor type, and then engaged in conversation with each of the four humorous personalities and one that was designed to give neutral repair responses (non-humorous). Aggressive personalities were rated as the funniest, yet there was no clear connection between the participant’s humor style and their preferred voice assistant personality. While humorous responses were successful in repairing communication breakdowns, participants overall preferred non-humorous responses. This research provides insight into the role of humor in communication breakdown repair with voice assistants.},

Since chatbots often provide advice or guidance, we ask: do these aspects affect the user’s decision to follow their advice? We focus on two chatbot features that can influence user perception: 1) response variability in answers and delays and 2) reply suggestion buttons. We report on a between-subject study where participants made investment decisions on a simulated social trading platform by interacting with a chatbot providing advice. Performance-based study incentives made the consequences of following the advice tangible to participants. We measured how often and to what extent participants followed the chatbot’s advice compared to an alternative source of information. Results indicate that both response variability and reply suggestion buttons significantly increased the inclination to follow the advice of the chatbot.},

  abstract = {Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) increasingly leverage ‘humanness’ as a foundational design metaphor, adopting roles like ‘assistants,’ ‘teachers,’ and ‘secretaries’ to foster natural interactions. Yet, this approach can sometimes misalign user trust and reinforce societal stereotypes, leading to socio-technical challenges that might impede long-term engagement. This paper explores an alternative approach to navigate these challenges—incorporating non-human metaphors in VUI design. We report on a study with 240 participants examining the effects of human versus non-human metaphors on user perceptions within health and finance domains. Results indicate a preference for the human metaphor (doctor) over the non-human (health encyclopedia) in health contexts for its perceived enjoyability and likeability. In finance, however, user perceptions do not significantly differ between human (financial advisor) and non-human (calculator) metaphors. Importantly, our research reveals that the explicit awareness of a metaphor’s use influences adoption intentions, with a marked preference for non-human metaphors when their metaphorical nature is not disclosed. These findings highlight context-specific conversation design strategies required in integrating non-human metaphors into VUI design, suggesting tradeoffs and design considerations that could enhance user engagement and adoption.},

  abstract = {Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) are increasingly being deployed in the customer service field. However, their user experience post-adoption remains under-researched. Through interviews with customer service practitioners and review of existing ECA research, we identified eighteen key items of ECA experience. Based on these items, we conducted a survey among users who have interacted with ECAs. Utilizing exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, we developed a five-dimension model: trustworthy, approachable, humanized, engaging, and supportive experiences. We found that the evaluation of experience importance varied according to users’ educational backgrounds and annual incomes. Users with higher education and income levels exhibited higher expectation for trustworthy experience. Additionally, our research suggests that the design features of ECAs contribute distinctively to these five user experience dimensions. These insights provide novel directions for adopting a user-centered design approach to improve ECA interactions.},

  abstract = {Regular physical activity is crucial for reducing the risk of non-communicable disease (NCD). With NCDs on the rise globally, there is an urgent need for effective health interventions, with chatbots emerging as a viable and cost-effective option because of limited healthcare accessibility. Although health professionals often utilize behavior change techniques (BCTs) to boost physical activity levels and enhance client engagement and motivation by affiliative humor, the efficacy of humor in chatbot-delivered interventions is not well-understood. This study conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine the impact of the generative humorous communication style in a 10-day chatbot-delivered intervention for physical activity. It further investigated whether user engagement and motivation act as mediators between the communication style and changes in physical activity levels. 66 participants engaged with the chatbots across three groups (humorous, non-humorous, and no-intervention) and responded to daily ecological momentary assessment questionnaires assessing engagement, motivation, and physical activity levels. Multilevel time series analyses revealed that an affiliative humorous communication style positively impacted physical activity levels over time, with user engagement acting as a mediator in this relationship, whereas motivation did not. These findings clarify the role of humorous communication style in chatbot-delivered interventions for physical activity, offering valuable insights for future development of intelligent conversational agents incorporating humor.},

Office environments have been relatively understudied, leaving a gap in understanding the essential factors for designing a VA specifically for work settings. In this study, we developed the WorkFit VA specific for the office environment, focusing on the health and well-being of knowledge workers. WorkFit was designed to monitor knowledge workers for sedentary behavior, inconsistent hydration, and stress, and to deliver proactive voice interventions followed by a health recommendation to mitigate those issues. We evaluated WorkFit in a field study with 15 knowledge workers for 5 working days. In the study, we determined challenges and opportunities for voice interactions in work settings. We identified contextual factors for identifying inopportune moments for voice interactions in an office setting. We found that 92\% of knowledge workers accepted WorkFit’s hydration interventions while 79\% of them engaged in walking breaks. Moreover, breathing exercises recommended by WorkFit significantly stabilized the heart rate of knowledge workers during stress. Based on our findings, we propose five design recommendations for the development of VA customized to office settings.},
